# Hirademy Assignment Solution

## Overview
This repository contains an assignment solution for Hirademy. The assignment involves creating an assistant with a unique ID and implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a MySQL database. The assistant's data can be retrieved either by a specific ID or all records can be fetched from the database. Additionally, the system supports updating and deleting records based on their unique IDs.

The tech stack used is Spring boot for backend along with the MVC architecture and verification using Postman.
It also implements the Javax validation packages and JPA repository for efficiency. 
Both, error and exception handling, are done for a better experience along with implementation of interfaces and several different abstraction methods for data and method security purposes.
